 * The Babylonian square root calculation of a value n, algorithm works as
 * follows:
 * 1.) Guess at the correct square root (n/2 maybe?)
 * 2.) Calculate root = n / guess
 * 3.) Let guess = (guess + root)/2
 * 4.) Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the square root is resolved.
 *
 * Implement the above algorithm and repeat steps 2 and 3 five times. Copy/pasta
 * is your friend here.

 // prompt user for input and parse input as floating point data type

 // create a floating point type variable named guess and assign it half input value
 // create a floating point type named root
 
 // assign root input / guess

 // assign guess (guess + root)/2
 
 // assign root input / guess

 // assign guess (guess + root)/2

 // assign root input / guess

 // assign guess (guess + root)/2

 // assign root input / guess

 // assign guess (guess + root)/2
